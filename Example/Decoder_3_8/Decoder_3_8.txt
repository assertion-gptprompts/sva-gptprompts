* function: 
8-bit Shift Register Shift register with enable
*  description:  
A shift register module. When the clock signal rises, the value of the output signal q is updated according to the state of the reset signal and the enable signal. 
 
The steps of the code are as follows: 
1. Define an input clock signal clk, reset signal rst, enable signal en, and an input signal d and an output signal q. 
2. Define an 8-bit register q. 
3. Use the always block to perform the following operations when the clock signal rises. 
4. If the reset signal rst is true, set the value of the output signal q to 8 zeros. 
5. Otherwise, if the enable signal en is true, update the value of the output signal q to the new value composed of the first 7 bits of q and the input signal d.
