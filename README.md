# sva-gptprompts
This directory is used for systemverilog assertion GPT autogeneration.
SystemVerilog Assertions(SVAs) are used in IC verification tools, such as formal verification tool and simulation tool. Engineers need spend much efforts to write SVAs. With the disruptive LLM technology, we want to realize the SVA generation automation. 

Developing Environment: Currently we use VS Code and the plugin Bito for SVA generation automation. Bito use google PaLM2 LLM engine. We would like to use more GPT engines: Chat-gpt, Llama2.
Verification Environment: We use the formal verification tool AveMC online version to verify the results. The website is  https://onlineeda.arcas-da.com/#/AveMC
